# CPRESTAPI
CPRESTAPI is a Java-based project showcasing a content management system for a blogging website developed using the Spring Framework and its associated projects. The website leverages key Spring modules including Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Boot, and Hibernate/JPA for efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, advanced queries, and robust backend/REST API architecture. Noteworthy features include OTP-based authentication for enhanced security and basic authorization mechanisms. The project serves as a practical demonstration of these technologies, offering insights into their seamless integration and functionality within a blogging platform.
